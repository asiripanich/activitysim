This repo is a fork of [ActivitySim](https://activitysim.github.io/activitysim), an activity-based travel behaviour modeling software. 
The goal of this project is to create an ActivitySim model of the Greater Melbourne region, Australia, using only datasets that are publicly available online.
To achieve our goal, we need to estimate the [sub-models](https://activitysim.github.io/activitysim/v1.1.3/models.html) of ActivitySim and prepare its initial input datasets such as a synthetic population, travel survey, skim matrices, and land use. We are molding 

The Greater Melbourne region was chosen for this project due to its superior data availability than other states in Australia (big shout out to Transport for Victoria!). In the land of Kangaroos, it is not often that household travel survey data are publicly shared at very detailed unit record level.

The current state of development of the Melbourne implementation of ActivitySim can be tracked in the [`scenarios/melbourne`](https://github.com/asiripanich/activitysim/tree/melbourne/scenarios/melbourne) folder of this repo.
